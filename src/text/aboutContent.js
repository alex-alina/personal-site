  greeting: "Hi there!",
  intro:
    "I'm Alina, an energetic web developer with a passion for building user-centered apps, a background in project and team management and a history of driving team growth through mentoring, training and good communication skills.",
  paragraphOne:
    "I’m a no nonsense kind of person, focused on teamwork and delivering useful solutions to end users. I’m a practitioner of open and honest communication and don’t shy away from giving or receiving feedback. My focus includes both self-development and team development, as continuous learning has proven to be the main ingredient for increasing efficiency in any setting I’ve worked in.",
  paragraphTwo:
    "I worked with the React ecosystem for 2.8+ years, but I'm always open to learn how to use other libraries, languages and tools when work requires it. I’m comfortable working with both legacy and greenfield projects and I prefer tech stacks that match the business needs more than the latest and coolest ones.",
  paragraphThree:
    "My quiet time is spent making tiny origami gardens, reading, going for walks and taking friends out for coffee.",
